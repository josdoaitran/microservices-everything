## Microservice Architecture
Microservices - or microservice architecture - is an architectural style to develop the application that structures an application as a collection of minimal componnent as services.
They are seperated by: 
+ Business purposes or capabilities.
+ Deploymenent independently.
+ Developed, Deployed, Managed by smaller team.

Then, each microservice will have these properties:
+ Independently deployable
+ Serveral integration partterns with other microservices (sync, asyns, ...)
+ Can be tested isolatedly and can be tested in integration level and integrated levels.
(When your application are designed and developed in microservices architecture, the demands of your software will be more and more complex)
