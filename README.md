# Event Driven everything
In this space, we collect all documents, links, tutorial about event-driven and testing for event-driven architecture.

Before we can go with "Event-Driven" architecture, we should have the overal view about [Microservice archtecture](https://github.com/josdoaitran/solid-and-microservice-everything)
# What does means "Event-Driven" ?
- When we mention about "Event-Driven", we are considering the communication parttern that our microservices communicates togethers in our architectures.
- Thankfully, event-driven microservices enable real-time communication, allowing data to be consumed in the form of events before theyâ€™re requested.

## Example System Artchitecture with Event-Driven
- Event Notification.
- Event-carried State Transfer
- Event Sourcing.
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation.

## Event-Driven with RabbitMQ
- RabitMQ: https://www.rabbitmq.com/
Example:

## Event-Driven with Kafka
- Apache Kafka: https://kafka.apache.org/
Besides that, if we use AWS native service, we can take advantage of AWS MSK servivce (Serverless), instead of using Kafka server. https://aws.amazon.com/msk/
