# Overview
In this note, we are collecting the update-to-date information about technical design for front-end of an application.
Then, helping us to have the better testing approaches.

We understand that the demands of E2E testing for an application is very essential. However, it takes us time, resources, maintaining costs.
And E2E testing will have the presentation layers as the highest layers for EndUser use our application.
The understanding the architecture of front-end is helpful to have the proper testing plans. Instead of covering all test cases of UI E2E testing, we are basing the changes in each build of application to have the relevant testing approachs. 
It will help us reduct the cost and prevent the redudant efforts.
